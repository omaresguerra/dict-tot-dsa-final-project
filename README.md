![Project Logo](outputs/header.png)

## Project Overview

This project, titled **Scorching Heat**, aims to analyze the heat temperatures of major cities in the Philippines through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The project is part of the final requirement for the **Training of Trainers on Data Science and Analytics 2024**, hosted by DICT Region 2. The primary objective is to provide insights into temperature patterns and trends, as well as to identify significant climatic factors affecting these cities.

## Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing of temperature datasets from various Philippine cities.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends, anomalies, and insights into heat patterns.
- Visualize the data using various plots and statistical tools for clear understanding.
- Draw meaningful conclusions from the data to support further research and policy recommendations.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Processes to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key insights derived using statistical summaries, distribution analysis, and correlation checks.
- **Visualizations**: Line plots, bar plots, box plots, and density plots showcasing the data's underlying patterns.
- **Summary of Findings**: A detailed section on the interpretation of results, with potential causes and effects of heat patterns in different cities.

## Tech Stack

- **R**: The primary language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: For creating visually appealing plots and charts.
- **dplyr**: To manipulate data and perform transformations.
- **readr**: For data input/output operations.
